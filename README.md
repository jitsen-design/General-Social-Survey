This project atttempts to predict a person's level of happiness by observing responses to their answers to the General Social Survey (GSS) questionnaire. The GSS has been an important measure of US demographic trends since 1972.

GSS_Three_Class.ipynb : This notebook runs models on three categories of happiness ('Very Happy', 'Happy' and 'Unhappy'). 

GSS_Two_Class.ipynb : This notebook eliminates the middle category of 'Happy', since much of the misclassification occurs with this class. While in reality eliminating this class is not feasible, this was an exercise in looking at the performance of different models when a nebulous category was eliminated.

GSS_Income_Party : This notebook looks at the difference in happiness of registered Reublicans vs that of Democrats. It also looks at the disparity in happiness between high income earners and low income individuals
